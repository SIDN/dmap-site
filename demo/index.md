# DMap Alexa 1M dataset and analysis
  
## Notice:

  * Commit date: Tue Feb 27 11:45:47 UTC 2018

## Goal: 
  * [DMap][1] is our multi-application measurement tool.
  * In this document, we present the results produced by [Dmap][1] after crawling Alexa 1M domains.
  * In this way, users can reproduce Table III from our [DMap paper](../paper.pdf) , and understand how to do measurement analysis using simple SQL code.

  
  
## Requirements:
  * [PostgreSQL DB][3]
  * Any SQL client that can connect to postgresql

## 1. Download the data and set it up 

   * You can download the 1 million scan results from [this link](https://dmap.sidnlabs.nl/demo/pg_dump_export_20180227.zip).
   * Then install it at your already configured [PostgreSQL DB][3] using the following command:
   

```bash
# unzip file
$ unzip  pg_dump_export_20180227.zip

# create database
$ createdb -T template0 DMapdb

# import the data
$ psql DMapdb < pg_dump_export_20180227
```

## 2. DNS
 
   * From this point onwards, we show the results of Table III in the paper, and which queries/python code we use to obtain these numbers
   

#### 2.1 DNS results from Table III in [DMap paper][2]:

|*Metric* |*IPv4* |*IPv6* |*IPv6/IPv4*|
| --------| ------|-------| ----------|
|# Domains (OK) |972,155|153,485|0.16|
|# Unique NSes |289,014|26,127|0.09|
|# Unique IP |210,650|19,754|0.09|
|# Unique ASes |18,418|3,178 |0.17|
|# CDN Cloudflare |117,538|115,396 |0.98|

#### 2.2 SQL queries to obtain these results


*IMPORTANT:*  crawl_run=67 is a ID of this entire measurment, and it' s a fixed value in all queries here.

```sqlite-psql
--Domains (OK)

--IPv4(crawl_status=0 means no error during crawling)
select count(1) from crawl_result_dns  
where crawl_run=67 and ip_version=4 and crawl_status=0

--IPv6 (crawl_status=0 no error)
select count(1) from crawl_result_dns   
where crawl_run=67 and ip_version=6 and crawl_status=0


-- unique IPs (IPv4)

select count( distinct uq_ip)
from (select json_array_elements((jsonb_array_elements(dns_ns)->>'addresses')::json)->>'address' as uq_ip
from crawl_result_dns
where dns_ns is not null 
and ip_version = 4
and crawl_status = 0
and crawl_run = 67)as ips

  
-- unique IPs (IPv6)

select count( distinct uq_ip)
from (select json_array_elements((jsonb_array_elements(dns_ns)->>'addresses')::json)->>'address' as uq_ip
from crawl_result_dns
where dns_ns is not null 
and ip_version = 4
and crawl_status = 0
and crawl_run = 67)as ips

--unique NSes (IPv4)

select count( distinct lower(ns_name))
from (select jsonb_array_elements(dns_ns)->>'name' as ns_name
from crawl_result_dns
where dns_ns is not null
and ip_version = 6
and crawl_status = 0
and crawl_run = 67)as ns_names

and crawl_run = 67)as ases

---cloudflare

select count(domainname) from  crawl_result_dns   
where crawl_run=67 and ip_version=4 and crawl_status=0

select count(domainname) from  crawl_result_dns 
  where crawl_run=67 and ip_version=6 and crawl_status=0 
 and dns_cdn_cloudflare=true

   * Here is part of the queries, for the remaining see the [smtpstats.py][4].
